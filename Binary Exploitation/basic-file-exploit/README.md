# Basic-file-exploit

## Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here.

## Approach
From the file, it seems that `strtol()` is used to convert input into a long int.
```
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
```
Inputting 0 as the entry number would give the flag.

## Solution
After entering a phrase, I was able to get entry 0 from the database. This gave the flag of: picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_E0394EC0}
