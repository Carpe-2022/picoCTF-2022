# morse-code

## Description

Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this?
Download the file here.
Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.

## Approach
The challenge gives a wav file that contains a morse code message.
In order to decrypt this file, I used https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html and uploaded the file.
This gave me the text: `WH7 H47H 90D W20U9H7` which converts to `wh47_h47h_90d_w20u9h7`

## Solution
picoCTF{wh47_h47h_90d_w20u9h7}
