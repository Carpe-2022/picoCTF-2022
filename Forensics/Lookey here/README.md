## Description

Attackers have hidden information in a very large mass of data in the past, maybe they are still doing it.
Download the data here: https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/295/anthem.flag.txt

Hint: Download the file and search for the flag based on the known prefix.

## Approach

Downloading the file and using `CTRL+F` or any command line tool (such as `grep`) reveals the flag: picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_58f5c024}
