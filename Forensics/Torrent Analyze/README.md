# Torrent Analyze

## Description

SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like `picoCTF{filename}`. [Captured traffic](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/206/torrent.pcap).

Hint 1: Download and open the file with a packet analyzer like Wireshark.

Hint 2: You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols

Hint 3: Try to understand peers, leechers and seeds. [Article](https://www.techworm.net/2017/03/seeds-peers-leechers-torrents-language.html)

Hint 4: The file name ends with `.iso`

## Approach

We are provided with a packet capture file. Ensure the bittorrent protocols - specifically BT-DHT - are enabled in Wireshark, as they may not enabled by default (Analyze > Enabled Protocols). Here's a quick summary of torrenting:
* Seeds are active torrent clients that have a copy of the complete file, and are sharing.
* Peers are those who are downloading the file. 
* Filenames are identified in each packet by `info_hash`

So, we should be looking for `info_hash`. We can find all packets with this term by using the built in search function. We can also further narrow this down by looking for packets with a source address from the local network (192.168.73.132). Here is our filter: `bt-dht.bencoded.string contains info_hash and ip.src == 192.168.73.132`

The resultant packets all have the same `info_hash` value: `e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e`. A quick Google search reveals the filename: `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso`.

Thus, the flag is: picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}
