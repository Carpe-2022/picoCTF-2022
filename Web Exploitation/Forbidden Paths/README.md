# Forbidden Paths

## Description

Can you get the flag?
Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:50363/).
We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Approach

Judging by the title and description, this challenge involves path-traversal. We know the location of the flag, and can retrieve it through the filename input. The `../` sequence allows access to arbitrary files and directories. We can input `../../../../flag.txt` as the filename, which will reveal the flag: picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}
