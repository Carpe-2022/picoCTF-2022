# Roboto Sans

## Description

The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.
Check [this](http://saturn.picoctf.net:51108/) out.

## Approach

The website's webpage provided isn't of real interest, as stated in the challenge description. The title is a big hint - we can go to /robots.txt, a file used to instruct webcrawlers. Here's what's shown:
```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```
The second line ends with a `==`; this means it may be in Base64. Decoding this, we get `js/myfile.txt`. We can then go to /js/myfile.txt and look further. The flag is: picoCTF{Who_D03sN7_L1k5_90B0T5_22ce1f22}
